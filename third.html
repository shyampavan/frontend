      <h1>The mysterious temple and the humanness of monkeys</h1>
      <img src="/home/shyam/Desktop/download.jpeg" alt="logo" height="200" width="500" />


   <p> I’d always felt that monkeys were different from other animals. With monkeys, you can sense their intellect and complex mind. When you lock eyes with one, you know they’re getting a read on you. They’re relatable in a way that a bear or a
        turtle isn't. </p>
      <p>
        One day in Hampi - an arid, historic land in south India rich with temples and boulders - we decided to rent a scooter and hike up to the Hanuman temple which overlooked the whole area. Lord Hanuman is ’the Monkey God’ in Hindi texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t a long hike; 30 minutes to reach the temple. The path was a steep set of dusty light brown stairs, and it was hot. Sweaty stinking hot.
      </p>
      <p>
        About ten minutes into the hike, we turned a corner into a tunneled portion. The tunnels were installed in certain parts of the hike to protect people from the sun. Anyway, we turned into this tunnel to see about 20 monkeys looking up at us
        and hopping around.
      </p>

        Here’s the thing about monkeys: we know what they’re capable of and we don’t know how to trust them. The other people walking up the trail with us seemed unfazed by the gang of monkeys. Which brings me to a lesson I’ve learned while
        traveling: sometimes you have to trust the way the locals move and just say ‘fuck it’. In the moment we didn’t think much about it (aside from waiting to follow a group of locals through).
      </p>

      <p>
        On our hike back down, there was a monkey on the right side of the tunnel eating a bag of Doritos. I poked Oana and pointed at the monkey, “Check it out - this monkey’s eating Doritos!”
      </p>


   <p>
        Before I had a second to turn back, the monkey had dropped his bag of chips and grabbed my shirt with his hand. He grabbed me the way an angry senior would grab a freshman and when he wants to shove him against a locker. Then, he looked me in
        the eyes and hissed. It was a quick, “Hey! What the fuck are you doing pointing at my Doritos?”
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point all I’m thinking is, ‘Holy shit.’ I’m in the monkey tunnel on this sweaty South Indian day and one of the monkeys is getting aggressive toward me specifically. Not only that - his aggression toward me felt so human. Standing
        within the walls of his domain, I felt like there was nothing I could do but try to back away slowly. He’s got a legion of other monkeys there with him and this could quickly turn into chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        I put my hands up: “Whoa whoa we’re cool man. I don’t want any of your chips. It’s allll good buddy.”
      </p>
      <P>
        He gave me a good stare, let my shirt go, snatched his bag of Doritos, and continued munching.
      </P>
      <p>
        I was stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another monkey moment stands out to me from India…
      </p>
      <p>
        In Rishikesh, there is a historic suspension bridge called Laxman Jhula that thousands of people - and cows - went across each day. It was about a cow-and-a-half wide and it was always packed. One day as we were slowly making our way across
        in a dense throng of people, I watched a monkey run up the suspension cable above the bridge. Then he turned around and started shitting directly onto the pedestrians. It was so deliberate and hilarious.
      </p>
      <P>
        And thus, the monkeys in India have spunk.

      <h1>The Five Monkeys Experiment (with a new lesson)</h1>
      <img src="/home/shyam/Desktop/Like+a+monkey+in+a+cage.jpg" alt="logo" height="200" width="500" />
      <h3>October 26, 2013</h3>
     <p>
        Consider yourself lucky if you ever get the opportunity to hear Eddie Obeng give a talk. My first introduction to him was a video of his TED talk on “Smart failure for a fast-changing world”. This week at JiveWorld, he gave the keynote
        speech. With passion and some unorthodox presentation techniques, he walked us a through a range of practical insights about human beings and ways to change behavior. Everyone loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end, he closed with a story about five monkeys that captures the state of things in most organizations and that provides hope, indirectly, for how we can make things better.
      </p>

      <p>
        An experimenter puts 5 monkeys in a large cage. High up at the top of the cage, well beyond the reach of the monkeys, is a bunch of bananas. Underneath the bananas is a ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monkeys immediately spot the bananas and one begins to climb the ladder. As he does, however, the experimenter sprays him with a stream of cold water. Then, he proceeds to spray each of the other monkeys.
      </p>
       <p>
        The monkey on the ladder scrambles off. And all 5 sit for a time on the floor, wet, cold, and bewildered. Soon, though, the temptation of the bananas is too great, and another monkey begins to climb the ladder. Again, the experimenter sprays
        the ambitious monkey with cold water and all the other monkeys as well. When a third monkey tries to climb the ladder, the other monkeys, wanting to avoid the cold spray, pull him off the ladder and beat him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now one monkey is removed and a new monkey is introduced to the cage. Spotting the bananas, he naively begins to climb the ladder. The other monkeys pull him off and beat him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s where it gets interesting. The experimenter removes a second one of the original monkeys from the cage and replaces him with a new monkey. Again, the new monkey begins to climb the ladder and, again, the other monkeys pull him off and
        beat him - including the monkey who had never been sprayed.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Monkeys at work
      </h2>
      <img src="/home/shyam/Desktop/the-office.jpg" alt="logo" height="200" width="500" />
      <p>
        By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys were left and yet, despite none of them ever experiencing the cold, wet, spray, they had all learned never to try and go for the bananas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metaphor and the lessons that apply to work are clear. Despite the exhortations from management to be innovative and collaborative, cold water is poured on people and their ideas whenever someone tries something new. Or, perhaps worse,
        the other employees suppress innovation, and learned helplessness spreads throughout the firm.
      </p>
      <h2>Now what? A modern lesson</h2>
      <p>
        As Eddie Obeng finished the story, we all nodded knowingly. And yet two questions sprang to mind:
      </p>
      <p>
        Did it ever happen?
      </p>
      <p>
        If so, what can we do about it?
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick search reveals it did happen though the details are quite different. In 1967. “Cultural acquisition of a specific learned response among rhesus monkeys” by Stephenson et al. (EDIT: Added the qualifier and updated the link to point
        directly to the original research paper. See the note below.) I found, like many good stories, the 5 monkeys story has been told elsewhere, though Eddie Obeng’s story-telling brings it to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original lesson seemed to be: “if you’re trapped with a malevolent experimenter, don’t go for the bananas”. Today, though, we can do something that wasn’t possible for those monkeys in 1967: we can change the experiment. That is, instead
        of just accepting the work environment we happen to be placed in, we can take more control now than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        By working out loud - making our work visible and discoverable - we can create purposeful networks and come in contact with wildly different experiments going on in your own firm and in organizations around the world. Different objectives,
        different incentives, different management styles, different support systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t have to take it any more. If you feel trapped, you can reach through the bars of your current environment and come into contact with possibilities you’d have never known about otherwise by working in a more open, more connected way.
        Today, whatever experiment you find yourself in, you can make your work and life better.
      </p>
      <P>
        Note: In the original post I said "It did happen" and that motivated a few people who pointed me to a thorough analysis of the paper I cited and how the lessons in the original research varied from this post. What I meant and should have
        written was that there was a study that was indeed the basis of the story, not that the research provided proof. After all, It was a small study with a few monkeys. Nevertheless, just as we teach our kids about the Five Little Monkeys Jumping
        on the Bed so they won't bump their heads, the story above serves as a cautionary tale that can help people be more mindful of what they're doing and why.
